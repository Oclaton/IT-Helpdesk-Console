## About IT-Helpdesk-Console
Several years ago I wrote a tool with a GUI which should make my work easier.

Actually, I thought I'd lost everything to the toll over time. But thanks to some old backups, I was able to restore some of it.

By querying the PC name, all the information I need is displayed and can then call up a few other tools.

At the time, I only knew a little VB and HTML.
Just look at in the original folder.

During the inspection I noticed that many server addresses are hard coded in different places. In retrospect, my stupidity annoys me.

## Intention
Now my idea is to rewrite the tool.

I have already written my first approaches as a WPF application and Powershell.
